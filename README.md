# Wiki Scraper

A simple Python script that fetches current country leaders from an API, saves them to JSON, pretty-prints their info (with clickable terminal links!), and pulls the first paragraph from each leaderâ€™s Wikipedia page.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Fetches country codes and leader data from `https://country-leaders.onrender.com`  
- Saves the results to `leaders.json`  
- Pretty-prints each leaderâ€™s:
  - Full name  
  - Birth date  
  - Place of birth
  - Wikipedia URL
- Extracts and prints the **first real paragraph** from a leaderâ€™s Wikipedia article  

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.13.2
---

## ðŸŽ¬ Usage

Simply run the script:

1. Fetches and saves all leaders to `leaders.json`.  
2. Pretty-prints each leaderâ€™s data in your console (with clickable hyperlinks if supported).  
3. Extracts & prints the first paragraph from the first leaderâ€™s Wikipedia page.  

---

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

- **`root_url`**  
  By default itâ€™s set to `https://country-leaders.onrender.com`.  
  To target a different API endpoint, edit the `root_url` variable at the top of `leaders_scraper.py`.

- **Output file**  
  The JSON dump is written to `leaders.json`. Change this in the `save(...)` call if you need a different path.

```text

  Place of Birth: Brussels
  Wikipedia url

...
First paragraph:

    },
    ...
  ],
